üß† CPU Scheduling Simulator
A Java-based graphical simulator that visualizes and analyzes various CPU scheduling algorithms. This tool is designed to aid students and educators in understanding how different scheduling strategies impact process execution and system performance.

üìå Problem Statement
In operating systems, CPU scheduling determines the order in which processes access the CPU. Different scheduling algorithms, such as First-Come, First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin (RR), and Priority Scheduling, have unique characteristics and performance implications. Selecting the appropriate algorithm depends on specific criteria like average waiting time, turnaround time, and response time. This simulator provides a platform to experiment with and compare these algorithms, facilitating a deeper understanding of their behaviors and trade-offs.
